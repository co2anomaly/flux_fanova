### Examples

Additional examples illustrating Bayesian functional analysis of variance. Code for the examples can be found in the top-level directory of the repository. Configurations (CSV and JSON) can be found in the `config` directory. MCMC diagnostic notebooks (R markdown) can be found in the `notebooks` directory.

The data analysis and statistical inference for the examples follow a similar general pattern

1. Data and configuration preparation
2. MCMC burn-in setup
3. MCMC burn-in sampling
4. MCMC burn-in evaluation
5. MCMC stationary (post burn-in) setup
6. MCMC stationary sampling
7. MCMC stationary evaluation
8. Final posterior summary
